Render a Class Component to the DOM
===================================

You may remember using the ReactDOM API in an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the DOM. The process for rendering React components will look very similar. The past few challenges focused on components and composition, so the rendering was done for you behind the scenes. However, none of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the ReactDOM API.

Here's a refresher on the syntax: `ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`. The first argument is the React component that you want to render. The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component within.

React components are passed into `ReactDOM.render()` a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example `ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode)`. You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.

Both the `Fruits` and `Vegetables` components are defined for you behind the scenes. Render both components as children of the `TypesOfFood` component, then render `TypesOfFood` to the DOM. There is a `div` with `id='challenge-node'` available for you to use.


```js
class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        <Fruits />
        <Vegetables />
      </div>
    );
  }
};

// Change code below this line
const root = document.getElementById('challenge-node');
ReactDOM.render(<TypesOfFood />, root)


```

Write a React Component from Scratch
====================================

Now that you've learned the basics of JSX and React components, it's time to write a component on your own. React components are the core building blocks of React applications so it's important to become very familiar with writing them. Remember, a typical React component is an ES6 `class` which extends `React.Component`. It has a render method that returns HTML (from JSX) or `null`. This is the basic form of a React component. Once you understand this well, you will be prepared to start building more complex React projects.

* * * * *

Define a class `MyComponent` that extends `React.Component`. Its render method should return a `div` that contains an `h1` tag with the text: `My First React Component!` in it. Use this text exactly, the case and punctuation matter. Make sure to call the constructor for your component, too.

Render this component to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`. There is a `div` with `id='challenge-node'` available for you to use.



```js

// Change code below this line

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My First React Component!</h1>

      </div>
    );
  }
};


const root = document.getElementById('challenge-node')
ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, root)
```

Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component
==============================================

The previous challenges covered a lot about creating and composing JSX elements, functional components, and ES6 style class components in React. With this foundation, it's time to look at another feature very common in React: **props**. In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an `App` component which renders a child component called `Welcome` which is a stateless functional component. You can pass `Welcome` a `user` property by writing:

```
<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>

```

You use **custom HTML attributes** created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property `user` is passed to the component `Welcome`. Since `Welcome` is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

```
const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>

```

It is standard to call this value `props` and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.

* * * * *

There are `Calendar` and `CurrentDate` components in the code editor. When rendering `CurrentDate` from the `Calendar` component, pass in a property of `date` assigned to the current date from JavaScript's `Date` object. Then access this `prop` in the `CurrentDate` component, showing its value within the `p` tags. Note that for `prop` values to be evaluated as JavaScript, they must be enclosed in curly brackets, for instance `date={Date()}`.



```js


```
